description: The following analytic detects potential privilege escalation threats in Azure Active Directory (AD). The detection is made by running a specific search
  within the ingested Azure Active Directory events to leverage the AuditLogs log category. This detection is important because it identifies instances where privileged
  roles that hold elevated permissions are assigned to service principals. This prevents unauthorized access or malicious activities, which occur when these non-human
  entities access Azure resources to exploit them. False positives might occur since administrators can legitimately assign privileged roles to service principals.
