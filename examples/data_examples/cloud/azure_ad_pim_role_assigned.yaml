description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Azure AD PIM role. Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service within Azure Azure AD 
  that enables administrators to manage, control, and monitor access to sensitive resources. PIM provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the
  risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources. Once a user has been made eligible for an administrative role, she must activate this role
  assignment to perform the privileged actions. When a role is activated, Azure AD PIM temporarily adds active assignment for the role. While PIM can be leveraged as a 
  powerful security control, it may also abused by adversaries to obtain privileged access. Security teams should monitor for the assignment and activation of PIM roles 
  and validate their legitimacy.
