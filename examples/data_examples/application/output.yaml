description: This analytic leverages Event Id 4768. A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested to identify one source endpoint trying to
  obtain an unusual number of Kerberos TGT tickets for non-existing users. This behavior could represent an adversary abusing the Kerberos protocol
  to perform a user enumeration attack against an Active Directory environment. When Kerberos is sent a TGT request with no preauthentication for
  an invalid username, it responds with KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN or 0x6.
